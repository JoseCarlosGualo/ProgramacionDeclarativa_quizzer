# Declarative Programming Quizzer

## Project Description
In this project, we are implementing a program where you can **easily** answer questions about the subject **"Programaci√≥n Declarativa"**. The purpose of this project is to have an easy way of **challenging** ourselves using questions about the subject, and helping us to study it. Now, let's see how this application works.

## Used technology

  In this section we are going to see the technologies that I've used to create the application, which are the following:

## Components
<center>
  In this project, we can find different components:
</center>

* **XLS files**: These files are the place where we **allocate** the different **questions**, including the **text**, the posible **answers**, and the number that represent which is the **correct answer**.
* **Python Code**: Python programs which, when is executed, it starts asking you the **questions**, and waiting for your answer. If the answer that you give is true, it will say you that it is **correct**, otherwise, it will say you that your answer is **wrong**.

## How it works
It is very **simple**, we just run the program with the including the **xls file with the questions** that the program will **ask** you. Then, the user will read the questions with the different possible answers, and the user will give the **answer by keyboard** introducing a **number** between **1** and **4**. Once the user has given an answer, the program will give some **feedback** about the given answer, and in case that the answer is not correct, it will give the user the correct one. Finally, when all the questions have been answered, the program will **finish**, giving you the **final mark** out of the total of the original questions.
